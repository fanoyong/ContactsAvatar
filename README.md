# ContactsAvatar

## Objective

For this task, 
1. Read the contacts list on your device.
2. Create avatars for all the contacts from [adorable.io](http://avatars.adorable.io/) and show the contacts list with the avatars as part of the app you create. You can decide what information to show on the list. Weâ€™d expect at least the name and phone number.
3. On clicking on a contact, show the contact details like email, address, etc.

## Architecture
For this task, utilize MVVM pattern plus data repository for single source of truth.

### Model
Data in this task is designed to be tiny POJO of local contact with following entries: name, e-mail, phone number and url for avatar (hash code of aforementioned data). Data is wrapped with [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) into SQLite. Single source of truth from local contact will be converted to aforementioned POJO on following condition: 1. For the first time DB is created. 2. When contact change is detected. 

### ViewModel
In favor of utilizing Android's lifecycle aware callback view mode, ViewModel is extending `AndroidViewModel`[Ref.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/AndroidViewModel.html). It observes DataRepository's data and once data is emitted, it will update its view (who is already subscribing to the change)
### View
Using Android's [data binding library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html), View is instantiated from its layout's variable. 
- For initial `RecyclerView` (`ContactListFragment`) is bind from `contact_item.xml`'s variable `contact` and `callback`.
- For detailed contact view, `ContactFragment` is bind from `contact_fragment.xml`'s variable `ContactViewModel`.

## Misc.
Along with basic requirement, it has following extensions
- Contact detail fragment will send proper intent based on user's interaction. (e.g. click on phone number will trigger dialer)
- Contact Fetch strategy: 
    - There are ways of detecting real time local contact DB change by running a service that registers `ContentObserver` for contact DB URI. However, for this task, this seems very "overkill" given contact DB change does not happen all the time.
    - Instead of the above approach, this app will fetch local contact DB when `Application` is created (`onCreate()`). I believe this is fair enough for 99% of use cases. 
- For sake of this task, following assumptions were used while accessing local contact DB
    - It will only query default contact db, not accessing external account (e.g. Google contacts)
    - It will use `Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME` for name
    - it will use following strategy to get both phone number and email address
        - If there exist multiple types of data, it will use whichever first appears in order of `Type.Mobile`, `Type.Home`,  `Type.Work`, etc.
        - If none of them exists, it will use default text "Not available";
    - Avatar URL is calculated using hash code of concatenated string of id / name / email / phone number
